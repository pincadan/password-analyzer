# Here is a simple Python script that analyzes a password and provides feedback on its strengt:

This script takes a password as input and checks its strength by verifying that it meets certain criteria:

1. The password should be at least 8 characters long.
2. It should contain at least one uppercase letter.
3. It should contain at least one lowercase letter.
4. It should contain at least one digit.
5. It should contain at least one special character.

If the password doesn't meet any of these criteria, the script provides specific feedback on what is missing. If the password meets all criteria, it returns a message indicating that the password is strong.

Remember to keep the password analyzer script for educational purposes only and never use it to validate real passwords in a production environment without proper security measures.
